## Graphics project is written in C++ using graphics.h library

This project creates a short animated film.

Since this project uses an outdated library, it will only run on select ide.
## Requirments:
* Install Emulated Turbo C++ ide
OR
* CodeBlocks with a separate MingW installation. Alternate instructions to [prepare CodeBlocks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/include-graphics-h-codeblocks/)

When running the code in CodeBlocks, code must be modified. Initialize variable 'i' in every for loop. This code is not meant to be run in CodeBlocks. While the code may execute, the results may not be the same.
